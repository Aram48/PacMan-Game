I developed an interactive Pacman game using JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. This project applies Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure game elements like Pacman, ghosts, and pellets, each represented as objects with properties and methods for movement and collision detection. The HTML5 Canvas API is used to create a dynamic 2D environment with smooth animations and real-time interactions. This project highlights my ability to implement complex game logic, apply OOP concepts, and work with Canvas to manage rendering and interactions.
